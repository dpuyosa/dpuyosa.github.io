    Respect your fucking craft. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans
    altogether? It’s getting fucking old. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. When you sit down to work, external
    critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself.
    Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting
    fucking old. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. Design as if your fucking life
    depended on it.

    If you fucking give up, you will achieve nothing. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope
    to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. Never let
    your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences.
    If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? If you fucking give up, you will achieve
    nothing. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it.

    What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. Design as if your fucking life depended on
    it. Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop
    clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. You are not your fucking work.
    Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are
    told you don’t have it in you to succeed. Use your fucking hands.
